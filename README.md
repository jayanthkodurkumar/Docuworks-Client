### INTRODUCTION

Welcome to DocuWorks Github Repository. The goal of this project is to build a real-time word editor which would enable users across different devices to work on the same
document at one time. The application utilizes ReactJS for handling client-side activities and NodeJS for handling server-side activities. Data is stored and accessed using MongoDB.

### IMPORTANT NOTE:

a. This part of the repository consists of only the client side of the application. You can access the server from [here](https://github.com/jayanthkodurkumar/Docuworks-Server).

b. You need both the server and the client versions to run the application as intended.

c. The app is not hosted. Please run it locally.
